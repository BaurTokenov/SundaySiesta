# SundaySiesta

Project for the Human-Computer Ineraction course at KAIST

This is a study about User Interface intended for people from small country communities in KAIST, who need help in organizing cultural events. Our target users lack support from their countrymen and but they are willing to showcase their culture to other. Our goal is to make the web site appealing, intuitive and user-friendly.
